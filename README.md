# React Pomodoro  

### Minimal requirements

- Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
- Four buttons:
  - **plus (+)** and **minus (-)**, they will allow the user to adjust the *minutes counter* - **only when it's stopped**.
  - **start**, to run the timer (it will then change to **stop**), to serve as a *toggle* button
  - **reset**, to… reset the timer to its original value
- At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to *take a break*. The modal will have two buttons:
  - One to close the modal
  - Another to close the modal *and* start a new timer

### Optional additions

You can add anything to the timer, sky is the limit

You can add a sound at the end of the timer, add another timer in the modal to limitate the break time, add animations… feel free to try anything!
